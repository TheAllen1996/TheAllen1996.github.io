The introductory [notes](https://github.com/TheAllen1996/Reinforcement_Learning_Notes) included **Bandit Algorithms**, **MDP**, **Model-free Methods**, **Value Function Approximation**, **Policy Optimization**. For the state-of-the-art advances, one can refer to paper directly and some excellent blogs.
