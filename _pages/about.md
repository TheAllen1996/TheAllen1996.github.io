Hi there! 

This is Allen. I currently work at Tencent as a game developer. Prior to joining Tencent, I obtained my master degree and bachelor degree, both in Computer Science, from ShanghaiTech University and South China University of Technology, respectively. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, working out, cooking, and chatting with friends.
