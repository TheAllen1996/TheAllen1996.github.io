It is often said that <i>'Going to Yangzhou in the third month when flowers are in bloom'</i> (烟花三月下扬州) is an ideal time for travel and enjoying the charm of Yangzhou.

As I mentioned in earlier posts, people in Shanghai tend to leave the city for vacation. We drive to Yangzhou this time to take in the sights. Even though it isn't exactly the third month of the lunar calendar, the view is still fabulous.
